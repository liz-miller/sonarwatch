Device Abstract: 
There are over 289 million people in the world who are visually impaired; of that 39 million people are blind, and 246 million people have moderate to severe visual impairment (WHO, 2011).  SonarWatch, a device for the visually impaired that resembles a wristwatch, is designed to improve mobility by giving the user sensory feedback of their surroundings while being inconspicuous. This product allows the user to benefit from their heightened sense of touch by sending vibration signals to a watchband to notify the user if there is an object within their environment.  SonarWatch will help users easily locate objects, such as items on a tabletop or shelf.  The hope for this product is to reduce the need for a cane or guide dog, while allowing independence for the individual.
